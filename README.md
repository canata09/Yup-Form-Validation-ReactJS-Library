# Plan
- Provide an example of setting up form validation in a React project using yup.
- Include necessary imports and basic setup for a form with validation.
- Show how to manually handle form state and validation using yup.

Here is an example of setting up form validation in a React project using yup.

1. *Install the necessary package*:
```bash
    npm install yup
```

2. *Create a basic form with validation*:
```bash
    app.js
```

This example includes:
- A simple form with two fields: email and password.
- Validation rules defined using yup schema.
- Manual handling of form state and validation with using yup.

You can extend this example by adding more fields and validation rules as needed.
